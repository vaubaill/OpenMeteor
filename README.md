# OpenMeteor
A collection of programs and links to programs for meteor observation processing (optic and radio)

AS of 2017, there are many softwares to process meteor data from optical or radio observations. Some are open source and/or free. The goal of this project is to 
- create an inventory of available softwares
- put together links to different code
- directly put some code

If your favorite software or code is not linked here by all means please add it :-)
